<h1>About my reproduction British Rail clock</h1>

<p>
  If you've come to this page from a search engine, <a href="/railways/british-rail-clock/">the clock itself is here!</a>
</p>

<p>
  This is a recreation of a British Rail analogue clock in HTML, CSS and Javascript.
  It is intended to be faithful to the design outlined in the original <a href="http://www.doublearrow.co.uk/manual.htm">British Rail Corporate Identity Manual</a>,
  and hopefully faithful to at least some of the clocks that were made in the real world.
</p>

<p>
  This should work in all modern web browsers, mobile &amp; desktop.
  I haven't tested Internet Explorer 11 as I write this, though I've tried my best to make sure it works there too.
  Bug reports are welcomed.
</p>

<h2>
  Hand timing
</h2>

<p>
  The second hand appears to move in a continuous sweep.
  It's actually every 1/50 of a second (20 milliseconds).
  This is slightly slower than the refresh rates of most modern computer & device displays
  (and much slower than 120 Hz mega-displays),
  which is why it might feel a little janky or hesitant. This is intentional!
</p>

<p>
  Why 1/50 of a second? These clocks were synchonised by the mains AC cycle, which in the United Kingdom is 50 hz (50 cycles per second).
</p>

<p>
  At zero and thirty seconds, the minute hand is advanced by half a minute (3 degrees), and the hour hand is advanced by a hundred and twentieth of an hour (0.25 degrees).
</p>


<h2>
  About mobile apps
</h2>

<p>
  A few days before I officially released this clock, I sent the link to a few people for their opinions,
  and they passed it to some other people,
  and even before I officially released it I received a couple of emails asking if I would release this as an app and/or widget for phones & tablets.
</p>

<p>
  Writing an app and/or widget for phones would require re-writing it at least twice; once for Android, once for Apple devices.
  I optimise for the reaching the largest number of people.
</p>

<p>
  Writing this for the web means I write it once and it works everywhere.
</p>

<p>
  Writing it for the web means that anyone can see it and play with instantly.
</p>

<p>
  Writing it for the web means that anyone can grab the code, tweak it, and find new and creative things to do with it.
  (For you techie people out there: this is why I have not minified the code, why there is no build system,
  and why it is all in one self-contained <a href="https://github.com/lewiscollard/british-rail-clock/blob/master/index.html">monstrosity of an HTML file</a>.
  I have optimised for ease of play &amp; tweaking.)
</p>

<p>
  A native app probably won't happen, because I have no interest in making one.
  But I sincerely hope the <a href="https://github.com/lewiscollard/british-rail-clock">code</a>
  might give someone an idea or two.

  Credits
</h2>

<p>
  This project would not have been started were it not for <a href="http://www.nickjob.co.uk/">Nick Job</a>, who accidentally inspired this project with a tweet.
  Nor would it have been possible to make this reproduction without his comprehensive <a href="http://www.doublearrow.co.uk/manual.htm">digitisation of the British Rail Corporate Identity Manual</a>, which was used as the primary reference material for this project.
  Check out his definitive <a href="http://www.doublearrow.co.uk/">website</a> and follow him for plenty more BR-era goodness <a href="https://twitter.com/_doublearrow">on Twitter</a>.
  (Any inaccuracies are entirely my own, and not a fault of his impeccable digitisation.)

<h2>
  Todo
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Add bezel options, once I get a feel for what was actually used in real clocks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add more variants!
    For example, I know that most real-world versions of this used a much thinner seconds hand than the one detailed in the style manual.
  </li>
  <li>
    ?? Your idea here! See "bugs & suggestions" below.
  </li>
</ul>
