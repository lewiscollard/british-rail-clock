<h1>About my reproduction British Rail clock</h1>

<p>
  If you've come to this page from a search engine, <a href="/railways/british-rail-clock/">the clock itself is here!</a>
</p>

<p>
  This is a recreation of a British Rail analogue clock in HTML, CSS and Javascript.
  It is intended to be faithful to the design outlined in the original <a href="http://www.doublearrow.co.uk/manual.htm">British Rail Corporate Identity Manual</a>,
  and hopefully faithful to at least some of the clocks that were made in the real world.
</p>

<p>
  This should work in all modern web browsers, mobile &amp; desktop.
  I haven't tested Internet Explorer 11 as I write this, though I've tried my best to make sure it works there too.
  Bug reports are welcomed.
</p>

  Credits
</h2>

<p>
  This project would not have been started were it not for <a href="http://www.nickjob.co.uk/">Nick Job</a>, who accidentally inspired this project with a tweet.
  Nor would it have been possible to make this reproduction without his comprehensive <a href="http://www.doublearrow.co.uk/manual.htm">digitisation of the British Rail Corporate Identity Manual</a>, which was used as the primary reference material for this project.
  Check out his definitive <a href="http://www.doublearrow.co.uk/">website</a> and follow him for plenty more BR-era goodness <a href="https://twitter.com/_doublearrow">on Twitter</a>.
  (Any inaccuracies are entirely my own, and not a fault of his impeccable digitisation.)

<h2>
  Todo
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Add bezel options, once I get a feel for what was actually used in real clocks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add more variants!
    For example, I know that most real-world versions of this used a much thinner seconds hand than the one detailed in the style manual.
  </li>
  <li>
    ?? Your idea here! See "bugs & suggestions" below.
